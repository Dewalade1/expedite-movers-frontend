# Expeditemovers Ltd. Official Website

This is the repo of the official website of Expeditemovers Ltd.

## Tools used

* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org) - to build the app
* [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) - for preview and production deployment
* [Vercel](https://vercel.com) - for hosting the app
* [Git and GitHub](https://git-scm.com) - for tracking, storage and version control

## How I worked on this Project

* I built the app based on `Let's Enhance` website design: [Link to website](https://letsenhance.io/)
* I used feature branches and pull requests in this Project
    * [Example PRs](https://github.com/Dewalade1/expedite-movers-frontend/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed)
    * [Example Branches](https://github.com/Dewalade1/expedite-movers-frontend/branches)
* I worked documented and fixed bugs using GitHub Issues: [Example Issues](https://github.com/Dewalade1/expedite-movers-frontend/issues)

## Why I built the Project this way

* I didn't use a state management library like Redux on purpose. For this app `useState` and `useReducer` hooks were sufficient. I realized that more and more projects don't use Redux anymore since GraphQL or react-query are often used for data management.

* UI libraries are a great place to find ready-made components that help speed up the dev process. They can also be handy if one only needs a few cusom components. For these reasons, I used `Bootstrap 4` and `Material UI` to style and build the contact form on this website.

* My plan is to become a FullStack Engineer eventually. This is why I chose to build a Custom RESTful API Server which can be found [here](https://github.com/Dewalade1/expedite-movers-backend). I built this API using the expressJS framework in NodeJS.
